# Bootstrap-Based Blog

## Description

This project is a Bootstrap-based blog website developed by Zunaisha Noor (BIET-F21-049) as a lab task. The objective of the assignment was to create a fully functional and responsive blog website using Bootstrap, demonstrating proficiency in utilizing Bootstrap's components and principles for web design.

## Features and Components

1. **Navigation Bar**: The website includes a responsive navigation bar at the top of the page with links to different sections of the blog.

2. **Blog Posts**: Multiple blog post cards are created using Bootstrap's card component. Each card includes a title, publication date, author name, a brief introduction, and a "Read More" button. The cards are organized in a grid layout using Bootstrap's grid system.

3. **Individual Blog Post Page**: A separate page is implemented for each blog post that opens when the "Read More" button is clicked. This page displays the full content of the blog post, including images and text. A button or link is included to return to the main blog page.

4. **Sidebar**: A sidebar is created on the blog page that includes categories, recent posts, and a search bar. Bootstrap components like lists and forms are used for these elements.

5. **Pagination**: Pagination is implemented at the bottom of the blog page to navigate through multiple pages of blog posts if there are many posts.

6. **Responsive Design**: The blog website is designed to be responsive and look good on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Bootstrap's responsive classes are used, and necessary adjustments are made to ensure responsiveness.

7. **Custom Styling**: Custom styles are applied to the blog using Bootstrap's utility classes and custom CSS to create a unique and visually appealing design.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the blog website.
- `blog-overview.css`: Custom CSS file for styling the blog overview page.
- `images/`: Directory containing images used in the blog.
- `README.md`: Markdown file providing information about the project.

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the blog website.
3. Customize the content, styles, and functionality as needed for your own blog.
